# Geomancer

This is tool originally made for generating volumes for use in the Pistol Mix editor from .png images, but the focus has shifted to make other changes to the map files easier. More functions are coming in later versions.

This tool is provided as is. Use at your own risk, though there isn't any, really. If you need help, shoot me a message and I might help you out, but keep in mind the tool is still very early in development, so issues are expected.

Made with Defold, using extensions by Bj√∂rn Ritzl, Sven Andersson and Sergey Lerg.

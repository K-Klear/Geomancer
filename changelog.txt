To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Auto-rotate for model viewer
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
- Add more easing types
- Tween preview
- Text fields in slices tab in wrong order

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/
- The colour guide button acts weird, probably because it's parented to the list background.
- Model viewer background doesn't stay put when resizing window
- Moving camera leaves the centre of rotation in place

Done:

Features:
- General:
	- Geomancer checks for volume index corruption on load and fixes it automatically
	- Active text fields are now highlighted
	- You can now navigate between text fields using tab/shift tab
- Reorganised the Import/Export screen:
	- Exporting without making a folder is now a checkbox rather than its own button
	- Added an "Import changes" button to easily redo all changes from a previously geomanced version of a map
		- Use checkboxes if you want to prevent this from making changes to one of the four affected files
		- For level information, all settings available in geomancer will be changed, everything else is kept (map name, author, description etc).
		- For events this will import all no-beat sections, event triggers and all but the first tempo sections.
			- PillarDrop and RisePillar events will be kept for maps with AirDrop or Spooky obstacle sets respectively and in case there's fewer of these than there are obstacles, additional events are created at the beginning of the map. In case obstacle set is unknown, both kinds of events are kept to be on the safe side.
		- For models this will update all materials and add tweens and dynamic status where possible, overwriting existing tweens. It will not remove tweens or dynamic status.
		- For enemies and obstacles this will take all with a type and/or sequence not available in Pistol Mix and try to match them with enemies/obstacles in the original file based on time, position and a few other values. If there's a match, the enemy will be updated. It will not attempt to change types/sequences which are present in Pistol Mix.
		- Removed redundant buttons previously used for this functionality on their respective tabs
	- Added De-geomance button which will remove all changes to the map which might conflict with Pistol Mix
		- Enemy, obstacle and material sets are kept, move mode and preview time is reset
		- All no-beats, event triggers and tempo sections except for the first one are removed
		- All tweens are removed and dynamic models are made static. All non-basic materials are set to "prop"
		- Wall and tunnels are changed to sidesteps and limbos, glitched enemies and flying skulls and all non-standard sequences are changed according to the config file. By default Normal, Normal Turret and Dance_03 respectively.
		- Geo information is kept as is
- Level tab:
	- Added map name
	- Added description. It gets cut off roughly in the same way the in-game description does, so if there's a part missing, it will probably be cut off in the game too. Note that the description defined in the map file is not actually used currently. Pistol Whip displays the description from mod.io instead.
	- Added enemy count and hit total. Includes unreachable enemies but not destructible props. Shield guys count as four hits, glitched enemies as one hit. Overshield adds four hits. This is only available if the pw_beat file is loaded.
- Model tab:
	- Temporarily removed the part selection button from the tween editor as that functionality might be currently broken. I will either fix it or remove it completely depending on further research.

Fixes:
- Enemy type selection dialog now remembers previous choice
- Tempo section start sample field no longer has a minimum value
- Maximum length of signals increased to 20 characters
- Status window gets cleared before export, preventing it from growing too large

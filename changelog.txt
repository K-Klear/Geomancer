To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Shift-click fields to delete contents
- have validation check if the value is function or just a value and remove all the dumb anonymous functions returning always the same thing
- Add a warning if no export happens before closing
- Store signals during model preview as hashes to make update() a tad faster.
- If a poster is not present in the map, generate a placeholder graphic
- Stop messing up the prop groups. And might as well implement my own way of organising them.
- Automatic frame-by-frame animation generation

- Option to show prop origin
- A way to expand a repeat action
- A "note" tween action
- Show a transform's properties during a tween preview
- Bulk changing of materials
- The metronome thing

Bugs:
- The check for Spooky and airdrop obstacle signals needs to be more robust
	- That is to say, it needs to happen on every export, not just while degeomancing, plus it needs to be smarter
- Had a dynamic model refuse to stay dynamic after switching tabs. No idea why.
	- Actually saw a wrong model turn dynamic. Something's fishy
		- Might be caused by sorting models - investigate!

Settings to implement in options:

Something for timeline height in map preview
probably remove default model z position as is it useless?
	Maybe it will see use in tween preview

Done:

Features:
- Added a "Find" button to the art tab to search in the model list
	- The search field accepts Lua pattern matching. This is unlikely to be useful, so don't worry about it.
- Added an "Instances" button to the art tab. This will bring out a list of all instances of the selected model sorted by Z position.
	- Specific prop properties (position, rotation, scale, spawn/despawn times) can be modified from this screen.
	- Use the eye icon to jump to a specific prop's position in map preview
- Map/tween preview now shows current time, total map length and percentage to the left and in the case of tween preview time relative to the start of the tween associated with the currently selected timeline to the right.
	- The units can be switched between seconds, distance in map units or samples according to the currently set sample rate

New shortcuts:

Fixes:
- The Load file button now lets you load .ogg files, which is an easy way to change the map's music.
- Colour override gets turned off when loading a new map
- Removed the "Load the position of the first instance of the prop when opening tween preview" option, as it is no longer necessary
- Changed the appearance of some buttons to a more space-efficient design
- Improved timing of prop spawns/despawns. Should be exactly the same as in-game.

Bugs:
- Fixed graphical glitches appearing during no-beat sections if BPM is set to 0.
- Any dialogs opened in model preview (colour) now get closed when switching tabs
- Fixed an issue preventing tween previews for props without corresponding signals from working
- Fixed incorrect tween preview length for some props with multiple tweens
- Fixed a bug preventing geomancer metadata from being written correctly
- Fixed an error when rewinding a map with a signal sent near the prop's despawn time
- Fixed a crash when replacing the last model on the list with a different one
- After a model is replaced, model count is now updated
- Fixed an issue when refreshing a list with a lot of entries
- Prevented a second copy of root tranform from being automatically created in some models

New options:
- Map preview -> Default time units

metronome_sound = 1 (0 - nothing, 1 - beep, 2 - click)

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog
- See if G.find_substring is still in use after I'm done with this

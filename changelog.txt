To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Lock view to base transform in tween preview
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
	- Scratch that - start implementing an actual options screen
- Maybe a player model?
- Catch errors when running out of available gui nodes, maybe? Might be worth on the preview timeline.
	- Alternatively just stop creating them when they're way too smooched together, but that sounds like work
		- Definitely worth it to not make separate ones for easings. But still work.
- Shift-click fields to delete contents
- have validation check if the value is function or just a value and remove all the dumb anonymous functions returning always the same thing
- Add a warning if no export happens before closing
- Add a "placeholder model" tag to hide specific props in previews
- Store signals during model preview as hashes to make update() a tad faster.
- If a poster is not present in the map, generate a placeholder graphic

Bugs:
- The check for Spooky and airdrop obstacle signals needs to be more robust
	- That is to say, it needs to happen on every export, not just while degeomancing, plus it needs to be smarter
- Had a dynamic model refuse to stay dynamic after switching tabs. No idea why.
	- Actually saw a wrong model turn dynamic. Something's fishy
		- Might be caused by sorting models - investigate!
- Fix time display in previews

Settings to implement in options:

sort out the colour situation
Something for timeline height in map preview
probably remove default model z position as is it useless?
	Maybe it will see use in tween preview
get rid of auto_set_tween_preview_prop

Bugs:

New options:


metronome_sound = 1 (0 - nothing, 1 - beep, 2 - click)

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog
- See if G.find_substring is still in use after I'm done with this

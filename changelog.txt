To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- Option to find and optionally fix Pistol Mix incompatibilities in a map
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Universal confirmation dialog, maybe?
- tabbing between text fields
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Unify atlases
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Filter events by signal
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/
- The colour guide button acts weird, probably because it's parented to the list background.
- Model viewer background doesn't stay put when resizing window

Done:

Features:
- Added Logs obstacle set from Voidslayer
- Adding new nobeats/events/tempo sections now opens the edit box. Can be disabled in config

Fixes:
- Added sidesteps as valid Spooky obstacle type
- Model part selection dialog now shows the currently selected part correctly
- Bulk enemy replace dialog properly resets when opened

Bugs:
- Fixed a bug which could result in action-less tweens under obscure circumstances
- Fixed a freeze when bulk replacing "Normal" enemy with "Normal Turret"
- Fixed a crash when clicking a text field in the tween editor while scrolling it

New configs:
- add_opens_edit_box

OLD BETA:

Features:
- Added a model preview to the model tab. It's a work in progress
	- Rotate the model by holding the left mouse button and dragging it
	- Move the camera by holding the right mouse button and dragging it, move forwards/backwards using the mouse wheel
	- Buttons at the bottom of the viewport in order:
		- Recentre the view
		- Toggle background (fog). Useful to examine props with fog-coloured materials
		- Toggle between ground, grid and nothing at the ground level
		- Select colour set. A dialog lets you pick from all unique colour combinations present in the map. The last option is always available and uses the initial Pistol Mix colours by default.
- Added bulk replace for sequences. The list of existing sequences is in the order they appear in the map
- Added easing for tween actions
	- Predefined easings inSine, outSine, inOutSine and linear. More *might* come later
	- Click and drag nodes to make a custom easing function
	- Right click a node to remove it, right click elsewhere to add a new node
	- You can set the number of nodes directly. This is disabled when the function is set to custom
	- Geomancer will split the tween action into the required parts on export. The actions will be separate next time you load the exported file
	- Actions with easing cannot be repeated. Repeat actions targeting them will be ignored.
- The delete tween button is now a trash can icon. I will probably use that elsewhere too, later.

Fixes:
- Increased character limit on tween start/end states to 10
- The tab buttons at the bottom can no longer be pressed using the mouse wheel or the keys ctrl, c and v.
- model_show_grid value gets clamped to within 1-3

New configs:
- colour_highlight_replace_enemy (colour) - sets the colour of the selected enemy types when replacing them in bulk
- ignore_char_limit (boolean) - makes all text fields ignore character limits
- bulk_sequence_sort 

CHECK IF IMPLEMENTED!!!
- easing_node_scale = 0.5
- easing_curve_thickness = 3
- easing_node_colour = vmath.vector4(0, 0, 0, 1)
- easing_node_highlight_colour = vmath.vector4(1, 0, 0, 1)
- easing_curve_colour = vmath.vector4(0, 0, 1, 1)

Bugs:
- Fixed a bug which prevented files with a full stop in their name from loading.
- Fixed a bug preventing tweens with wait and repeat actions from loading.
- Fixed an error when canceling out of the folder selection dialog when saving a tween
- Events now get correctly sorted when adding multiple

To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- Option to find and optionally fix Pistol Mix incompatibilities in a map
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Universal confirmation dialog, maybe?
- tabbing between text fields
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Unify atlases
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Help button!

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/
- The colour guide button acts weird, probably because it's parented to the list background.
- Dialogs sometimes show under UI in bundled version

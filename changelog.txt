To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Auto-rotate for model viewer
- Lock view to base transform in tween preview
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
- Maybe a player model?
- Catch errors when running out of available gui nodes, maybe? Might be worth on the preview timeline.
	- Alternatively just stop creating them when they're way too smooched together, but that sounds like work

Bugs:

Done:

Features:
- Removed volume generation and replaced it with a metadata tab consisting of two buttons:
	- Delete decor group information (effectively splitting each prop into its own group in Pistol Mix)
	- Delete all volumes (does not affect geo)
- Negative offsets now allowed when creating multiple events
- Added the Demon enemy set from Voidslayer

New shortcuts:

Fixes:
- Added a warning if .geomancer file fails to generate
- Reopening tween preview with POV lock enabled correctly resets the camera
- Material "ParticleMesh_GlowMultiply" now shows correctly as glow-coloured and shaded

Bugs:
- Fixed a crash when leaving the models tab if the loaded map has no model data
- Opening preview of a model without instances leaves the chose dialog open

New configs:

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog
- See if G.find_substring is still in use after I'm done with this
- Check if I should sort prop lists by position

To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Shift-click fields to delete contents
- have validation check if the value is function or just a value and remove all the dumb anonymous functions returning always the same thing
- Add a warning if no export happens before closing
- Store signals during model preview as hashes to make update() a tad faster.
- If a poster is not present in the map, generate a placeholder graphic
- Stop messing up the prop groups. And might as well implement my own way of organising them.
	- Yeah, maybe not... it's a mess
- Automatic frame-by-frame animation generation

- Option to show prop origin
- A way to expand a repeat action
- A "note" tween action
- Show a transform's properties during a tween preview
- Bulk changing of materials
- The metronome thing

Bugs:
- The check for Spooky and airdrop obstacle signals needs to be more robust
	- That is to say, it needs to happen on every export, not just while degeomancing, plus it needs to be smarter
- Had a dynamic model refuse to stay dynamic after switching tabs. No idea why.
	- Actually saw a wrong model turn dynamic. Something's fishy
		- Might be caused by sorting models - investigate!
- It's possible to close model viewer while in FPS control mode. Turn it off in that case!
- Meshes in model viewer tend to disappear. Related to flashing?

Settings to implement in options:
- Something for timeline height in map preview
- probably remove default model z position as is it useless?
	-Maybe it will see use in tween preview

To-do (geo generation):
- Fix the collider rendering (depth buffer?)
- Prop deletion
- Icon graphics

Done:

Features:
- It is now possible to create geo (visible and/or invisible) from props, from the Instance dialog
	- Clicking the "Geo" button at the prop instance of your choice opens a dialog with options:
		- Select whether to generate visible geo, colliders or both
		- You may choose to delete the prop afterwards
		- Alternatively it can be automatically scaled to 0 to make it invisible, but still present in the map in case you want to reference it later
		- If there's more than one instance of this prop, you can generate geo from all of them at the same time
	- Geomancer keeps track of geo generated this way and will store this information in the geomancer metadata file on export
		- This allows it to regenerate these changes when importing changes from a previously geomanced map
		- There are also new buttons on the Geo/Colliders tab used to remove all geo created this way, as long as the metadata file is present
- You can now delete specific prop instances (trash bin icon in the instances dialog)
- Made geo rendering in previews more accurate
- Obstacles are now shown in preview (can be hidden)
- Improved how colliders are rendered (textured and transparent)
	- Collider display can be enabled/disabled independently from geo
	- Obstacles have collider graphics attached
	- Red colliders (geo and obstacles) hurt the player when going through them
	- Yellow colliders (found on some built-in props) only block shots
		- Props named "PF_CollisionCube_01_Flat" and "PF_CollisionCube_02_tall" are hardcoded to show as appropriately-sized colliders
- The find model dialog now opens with the text field selected
- Increased the maximum number of tween action repeats to 999

New shortcuts:

Fixes:
- Changes to geo made on the Geo / Collisions tab are now shown on the preview

Bugs:
- Fixed an error when opening the model viewer for a map with no props
- Fixed a bug preventing geo and props from despawning correctly when jumping around on the timeline
- Model viewer input is now correctly disabled when returning to the prop instance dialog
- Fixed an issue preventing enemy type from changing
- Material set "2089 - Alien Planet" is now named correctly

Options:
- Moved custom colour set to the Colours tab
- Collider colour setting has been split between strong (geo) and weak (bullet blockers) colliders and moved to the Colours tab
- Files -> Include geo data when importing changes

metronome_sound = 1 (0 - nothing, 1 - beep, 2 - click)

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog

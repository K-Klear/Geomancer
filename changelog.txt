To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- Option to find and optionally fix Pistol Mix incompatibilities in a map
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- tabbing between text fields
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Unify atlases
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Auto-rotate for model viewer
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/
- The colour guide button acts weird, probably because it's parented to the list background.
- Model viewer background doesn't stay put when resizing window
- Moving camera leaves the centre of rotation in place

Done:

Features:
- Tween editor title shows the model's name

Fixes:
- Deleting an event updates the filter information
- Fixed a bug causing parts of some models to appear with inverted normals

Bugs:
- Fixed a bug causing edit/remove event buttons to refer to wrong events if there's a filter applied
- Fixed a crash caused by trying to add an event from the tween editor without a loaded pw_event file
- Fixed a bug causing the model viewer grid to disappear when changing colours

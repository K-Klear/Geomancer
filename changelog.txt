To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Auto-rotate for model viewer
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
- Text fields in slices tab in wrong order
- Maybe a player model?


Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/


Done:

Features:
- Implemented all common easing functions
- You can set a model's position, rotation and scale on the tween preview screen
	- The values can be read directly from any instance of this prop present in the map
- Additional camera controls for tween previews:
	- Lock camera to roughly the player's view. The camera can only be rotated while this is active.
	- Move the camera to the origin of the model 
- Pressing delete will clear currently selected text field
- Pressing escape closes current dialog

Fixes:
- Tween preview playback now correctly stops at the end
- The first model is now selected when opening the model tab. Opening the tween dialog also selects the relevant model.
- Text fields within scrollable lists should display rounded values without bleeding out. The actual precise values are still used internally.
- Better message when importing beat data doesn't make any changes

Bugs:

New configs:

default_model_z_position (number)

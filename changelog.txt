To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Auto-rotate for model viewer
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
- Text fields in slices tab in wrong order
- Maybe a player model?

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures

Done:

Features:
- Selected mesh is flashing in the model preview window
- Disabled geo generator for now
- Added a check for mismatched prop key/object name on import.
- Added the "Odin" material set
- Choosing a specific prop for tween preview now also tries to find the signal activating its tween and sets its Z position accordingly.
- Reworked tween editor to support multiple tweens on the same prop:
	- Start by selecting one of the model's transforms to attach the tween
	- Tweens can now freely target any of the model's transforms
	- Tween preview will show the combination of all the model's tweens happening at the same time
		- Click a timeline to select this tween for editing after the preview is closed

New shortcuts:
- You can now move between the main tabs using the F1-F7 keys
- Press ctrl+E anytime to export changes
- Holding down shift when selecting a material will apply this material to ALL the meshes in the model

Fixes:
- Selected prop in tween preview only resets after closing the transform selection dialog
- POV lock no longer resets after exitting the tween preview
- Sample rate autodetection notification now shows up while loading map files
- Export is now a lot faster and supports large filesizes
- Increased some internal limits to better support unreasonably large models
- Model parts are now referred to as "Meshes" or "Submeshes".
- Saved tweens are now named [model name]_[transform name].pw_tween to allow saving multiple tweens attached to the same model without overwriting
- Tween previews should be more accurate

Bugs:
- Fixed a crash when trying to bulk change type of enemies in a map without enemies
- Fixed an error when attempting to render models with unknown format (Giant Walking)
- Material set "2089 - Arbiter" works correctly now
- Line breaks and apostrophes should now always show in description preview correctly. Other special characters may still display wrong
- Stopped "default_camera_pitch=25" being appended to the .cfg file with every launch

New configs:
mesh_flash_frequency
mesh_flash_time
mesh_flash_colour
tween_timeline_bar_height
use_default_transform_name
add_root_transform_if_missing - NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THE WORSE WAY!
allow_tweening_base_transform

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog
- See if G.find_substring is still in use after I'm done with this
- Check if I should sort prop lists by position
- Cannot copy a tween from another transform in the same model
- Add the demon enemy set
- Add an option to automatically pick the first prop instance when opening a tween

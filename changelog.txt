To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
- Find a way to detect sample rate though obstacle, enemy and possibly colour data

- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export

- Option to find and optionally fix Pistol Mix incompatibilities in a map
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
<<<<<<< HEAD
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Universal confirmation dialog, maybe?
- tabbing between text fields
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/
- The colour guide button acts weird, probably because it's parented to the list background.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Dialogs sometimes show under UI in bundled version

Done:

Features:

- Better input data validation for text fields
- Text fields accepting numbers now also accept math expressions (5+3 will result in 8), including the lua math library (try writing pi, for example).
- Laying groundwork for user customisation

- Level info editor:
	- Added close buttons to enemy, obstacle and material dialogs in the level info editor

- Event editor:
	- Values are shown in both seconds and samples by default and can be input as either when editing.
	- Nobeat sections additionally have a "duration" field.
	- Removed the ability to set the ending sample value for event triggers. It will be set to the same number as the start sample.
	- Removed the sample/second switch button as it is no longer needed
	- Due to the reworked UI it is no longer possible to change sample rate when an edit box is open

<<<<<<< HEAD
Bugs:
=======
- Model editor:
	- Smaller UI elments to fit more models and their parts on screen at once
	- Materials divided into similar groups based on Dual_ity's guide
	- Dynamic models and models with tweens are highighted in the list
	- Model importer now lets you pick any number of models from the selected file.
	- Model replacer has its own dialog

-Tween editor:
	- Tweens move the whole prop by default now.
	- If a model doesn't have a root transform, it is created on export as needed.
	- Smarter default values for new tween actions or when changing types
	- Rotation values are restricted to 0-360 by default. 540 becomes 180, -25 becomes 335.
	- Added a delete tween button
	- Added an extra action "Repeat". This will copy a number of preceding actions a number of times on export.
		- Note that after loading the map next time, this action will not be recognised and the tween editor will intead show all the copied actions.
		- Repeat actions trying to apply to another repeat action or with not enough actions before them will be REMOVED on export with a warning

Fixes:
- Text fields will no longer accept infinity as a value

Bugs:
- Fixed a bug when skipping existing models during import
- Fixed a bug causing model replacer to keep the original model's part names
- Fixed an export bug caused by importing an event file

To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Auto-rotate for model viewer
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
- Text fields in slices tab in wrong order
- Maybe a player model?


Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/
- Adding events from tween menu can use wrong samplerate


Done:

Features:
- Selected mesh is flashing in the model preview window
- Disabled geo generator for now

Fixes:

Bugs:
- Fixed a crash when trying to bulk change type of enemies in a map without enemies
- Fixed error when attempting to render models with unknown format (Giant Walking)

New configs:
SET.mesh_flash_frequency (not implemented)
SET.mesh_flash_time (not implemented)

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog
- See if G.find_substring is still in use after I'm done with this
- Check if I should sort prop lists by position
- Figure out a better way to save/load tween parts
- Cannot copy a tween from another transform in the same model

To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- Option to find and optionally fix Pistol Mix incompatibilities in a map
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Universal confirmation dialog, maybe?
- tabbing between text fields
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Unify atlases
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/
- The colour guide button acts weird, probably because it's parented to the list background.

Done:

Features:
- Added a model preview to the model tab. It's a work in progress
	- Rotate the model by holding the left mouse button and dragging it
	- Move the camera by holding the right mouse button and dragging it, move forwards/backwards using the mouse wheel
	- Buttons at the bottom of the viewport in order:
		- Recentre the view
		- Toggle background (fog). Useful to examine props with fog-coloured materials
		- Toggle between ground, grid and nothing at the ground level
		- Select colour set. A dialog lets you pick from all unique colour combinations present in the map. The last option is always available and uses the initial Pistol Mix colours by default.

Fixes:
- Increased character limit on tween start/end states to 10
- The tab buttons at the bottom can no longer be pressed using the mouse wheel or the keys ctrl, c and v.

New configs:
- colour_highlight_replace_enemy (colour) - sets the colour of the selected enemy types when replacing them in bulk
- ignore_char_limit (boolean) - makes all text fields ignore character limits

Bugs:
- Fixed a bug which prevented files with a full stop in their name from loading.

To do:

- Meta data purge
- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Allow BPM entry in BPM rather than samples per beat
- Find a way to detect sample rate though obstacle, enemy and possibly colour data
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- Model replacer
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- Option to find and optionally fix Pistol Mix incompatibilities in a map
- A settings file to allow configuration of default behaviours
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/

Done:

Features:
- Switching tabs no longer resets the current model page

Fixes:
- Importing from a directory no longer considers skipping the sequence file as an error
- The folder created by exports is now called [mapname]_geomanced, because why not.

Bugs:
- Fixed a crash when exporting a map containing PF_Mausoleum_Medium01 (and possibly some other stock props)

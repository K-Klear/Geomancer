To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Meta data purge button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- rps field for tween rotations
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Auto-rotate for model viewer
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
- Text fields in slices tab in wrong order
- Maybe a player model?

Bugs:

Done:

Features:
- Selected mesh is flashing in the model preview window
- Disabled geo generator for now
- Added a check for mismatched prop key/object name on import.
- Added the "Odin" material set
- Model list now shows number of each prop placed within the map
- Choosing a specific prop for tween preview now also tries to find the signal activating its tween and sets its Z position accordingly.
- Added a transform editor, accessed by using the tween button on the art tab
	- Transforms can be added, renamed, deleted and re-parented freely
	- Adding a transform adds it as a parent of all child transforms of the selected transform
		- Holding shift when clicking the add button adds it as the parent of selected transform instead
	- Transform properties can be seen and modified
	- A new base transform ready for tweening the whole prop gets created automatically first time transform editor is opened by default

- Reworked tween editor to support multiple tweens on the same prop:
	- Start by selecting one of the model's transforms to attach the tween
	- Tweens can now freely target any of the model's transforms
		- Tween actions now default to the initial state of selected transform
	- Tween preview will show the combination of all the model's tweens happening at the same time
		- Click a timeline to select this tween for editing after the preview is closed
	- Tween preview will now load the properties of the first prop instance when opened

- The model viewer can now optionally visualise the model's transforms, represented by a white sphere with directional arrows
	- The preview on the model tab can show either all or none of the transforms
		- Transform editor can also show only the selected transform
		- Tween preview can show only the one currently being affected by the selected tween

- Exporting a map now generates a [mapname].geomancer file
	- If loaded alongside of a map, it will reconstruct easings/repeats rather than showing them as separate actions.
	- The file can be safely bundled in the map file - Pistol Whip will ignore it and it doesn't take much space.
	- It also stores Geomancer version used to create it, though this is not used anywhere

- Added a "Separate actions" in the easing editor to split the easing.

New shortcuts:
- Certan dialogs can now be accepted by pressing enter
- You can now move between the main tabs using the F1-F7 keys
- Press ctrl+E anytime to export changes
- Holding down shift when selecting a material will apply this material to ALL the meshes in the model

Fixes:
- Selected prop in tween preview only resets after closing the transform selection dialog
- POV lock no longer resets after exitting the tween preview
- Sample rate autodetection notification now shows up while loading map files
- Export is now a lot faster and supports large filesizes
- Increased some internal limits to better support unreasonably large models
- Model parts are now referred to as "Meshes" or "Submeshes"
- Saved tweens are now named [model name]_[transform name].pw_tween to allow saving multiple tweens attached to the same model without overwriting
- Tween previews should be more accurate
- Easing node's completion value is no longer hidden by the graph

Bugs:
- Fixed a crash when trying to bulk change type of enemies in a map without enemies
- Fixed an error when attempting to render models with unknown format (Giant Walking)
- Material set "2089 - Arbiter" works correctly now
- Line breaks and apostrophes should now always show in description preview correctly. Other special characters may still display wrong
- Stopped "default_camera_pitch=25" being appended to the .cfg file with every launch
- Fixed a crash caused by closing a dialog while a text field is active

New configs:
add_root_transform_if_missing
mesh_flash_frequency
mesh_flash_time
mesh_flash_colour
tween_timeline_bar_height
use_default_transform_name
root_transform_default_name
allow_tweening_base_transform
confirm_transform_delete
allow_mesh_delete
hide_model_count
auto_set_tween_preview_prop
show_transform_edit_warning

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog
- See if G.find_substring is still in use after I'm done with this
- Check if I should sort prop lists by position
- Add the demon enemy set

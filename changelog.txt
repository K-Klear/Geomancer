To do:

- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- The json sanitiser is dumb. Make it less dumb
- Reset buttons when a panel loses focus
- animations for moving/adding tween actions to make it more clear what's happening.
- Automatically resize text for text fields (and maybe buttons)
- Maybe "delete all" buttons for the event tab
- Custom dialog transparency?
- Show enemy position in the beat editor as a picture rather than text
- Custom sequence name support
	- Add a new section for sequences found among the enemies/in the sequence file?
- Add a cfg for default easing and number of nodes
- Option to view colliders in model viewer
- Lock view to base transform in tween preview
- Reorganise cfgs - look into the guide
	- Scratch that - start implementing an actual options screen
- Maybe a player model?
- Catch errors when running out of available gui nodes, maybe? Might be worth on the preview timeline.
	- Alternatively just stop creating them when they're way too smooched together, but that sounds like work
		- Definitely worth it to not make separate ones for easings. But still work.

Bugs:
- The check for Spooky and airdrop obstacle signals needs to be more robust
	- That is to say, it needs to happen on every export, not just while degeomancing, plus it needs to be smarter
- Had a dynamic model refuse to stay dynamic after switching tabs. No idea why.

Done:

Features:
- Enemy rotation tool
- Easings are no longer shown on the timeline in tween preview

New shortcuts:
F8 to go to the rotate tool

Fixes:
- Swiching between tweens is now done by right-clicking the timeline, to prevent accidental switches

Bugs:
- Fixed an error when attempting to import a model from another map
- Fixed a bug causing transform editor to display wrong rotation values
- Adjusting transform properties no longer changes which meshes are flashing
- Closing the colour menu no longer forces transforms to appear
- Event list no longer goes crazy when switching back to the event tab after scrolling to its end
- Renaming a transform is reflected in the mesh list on the main model tab

New configs:
rotate_multiple_axes
default_rotation_rounding

Notes:
- See if "MEM.event_reloaded" and similar are necessary. Currently load error unloads previous data - is that a bad thing?
- Check if importing a new enemy type doesn't mess up the bulk replace dialog
- See if G.find_substring is still in use after I'm done with this
- Check if I should sort prop lists by position

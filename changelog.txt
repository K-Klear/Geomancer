To do:

- Meta data purge
- Fix buttons firing when mouse is held, moved away and then returned to the button
- Check for illegal enemy types
- Allow BPM entry in BPM rather than samples per beat
- Find a way to detect sample rate though obstacle, enemy and possibly colour data
- Unload pictures button for geo slices
- Partial export
- Link the model spreadsheet from somewhere, maybe
- Model replacer
- "Smart" model dynamizer
- Option to find and optionally fix Pistol Mix incompatibilities in a map

Bugs:

- Volumes generate wrong on the edge of the pictures
- Geomancer gets rekt by whitespace =/

Done:

New:

- Tweening editor
- Import model properties (materials, dynamic state, tweens) from a different file
- A check whether the files contain valid json is now performed with every import and export, displaying the location of the error if found and aboring import or issuing a warning when exporting.
- Link to the colour guide on mod.io in model editor
- Links to the material and obstacle guide in level data editor

Fixes:

- Removed duplicated "geoSimple" material
- Added Defold logo to the landing page
- pw_art files without static prop lists now load properly. The (empty) lists are created on export.
- Page and item selections are now deleted when unloading files
- Clicking selected model again no longer resets the part list.

Bugs:

- Fixed a bug where only one prop within a culling range would have its dynamic status changed, the rest being deleted.
- Errors when importing should no longer leave any partial data loaded
- Fixed a crash when importing a file in human-readable format
- Event values in seconds now update if sample rate changed using the text field
- Fixed a crash when loading a file with fewer model pages than the page of the currently selected model
